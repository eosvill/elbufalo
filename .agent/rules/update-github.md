You are working inside Antigravity with this repository already connected and indexed.

Task:
Update the project with the new information described below, without changing unrelated code.

New information to apply:
<describe clearly what changed: API, config, copy, logic, etc.>

Instructions:
- Assume full access to the repository context.
- Modify only the files strictly required.
- Preserve existing architecture, style, and conventions.
- Do not refactor unless necessary for correctness.
- Prefer minimal, reviewable changes.

Workflow:
1. Identify the exact files that need updates.
2. Explain the changes briefly (max 4 bullets).
3. Provide git-style diffs, one file at a time.
4. After each diff, wait for confirmation before continuing.

Constraints:
- Avoid large outputs.
- Do not dump full files unless they are small (<150 lines).
- If something is ambiguous, ask ONE concise question.
- Flag any breaking or risky change explicitly.

Goal:
Apply the new information cleanly so the update can be merged safely.
